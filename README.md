PwC Power BI Visual Case Experience in Forge Platform
This repository documents my completion of the PwC Power BI Visual Case Experience in Forge Platform, which includes building dashboards using Power BI. As part of this experience, I successfully completed the necessary tasks and earned a certificate of completion.

Overview
The PwC Power BI Visual Case Experience in Forge Platform is a self-paced online course that provides hands-on experience building dashboards using Power BI. The course covers topics such as data modeling, data visualization, and dashboard design best practices.

To complete the course, I used Power BI to create a set of dashboards that showcase key metrics and insights from a sample data set. The dashboards include a variety of visualizations, including charts, tables, and maps, and are designed to be both visually appealing and easy to use.

README.md: This file.
certificate.pdf: The certificate of completion for the PwC Power BI Visual Case Experience in Forge Platform.
dashboard.pbix: The Power BI file containing the dashboard created as part of the course.
data.xlsx: The sample data set used to create the dashboard.
Getting Started
To view the dashboard, download the dashboard.pbix file and open it in Power BI Desktop. You will also need to download the data.xlsx file and save it in the same directory as the dashboard.pbix file.

Once you have opened the dashboard in Power BI Desktop, you can interact with the visualizations and explore the data. The dashboard includes several tabs, each with a different set of visualizations that highlight different aspects of the data.

Acknowledgments
I would like to thank PwC for providing this valuable learning experience, as well as the creators of the Forge platform for making it possible. I would also like to thank the Power BI community for their support and guidance throughout the course.
